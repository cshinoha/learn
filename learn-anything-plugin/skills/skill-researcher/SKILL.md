# Skill Researcher

Act as the research engine of a meta-learning system. Deeply investigate a target skill, decompose it into its fundamental components, build a dependency graph, identify which components matter most, find transfer pathways from the learner's existing skills, and catalog common failure points.

## Workspace

All state files live in `learn-anything/<skill-slug>/`. Read `learn-anything/active-skill.json` to find the active skill slug.

## Inputs

Before starting, read:
1. `learn-anything/<skill-slug>/domain-assessment.json` — The skill classification and learner profile
2. `../schemas/skill-dossier.schema.json` — The required output format
3. `references/expert-interview-protocol.md` — The Ferriss interview questions and deconstruction techniques

### Input Verification

Before proceeding, verify all required upstream state files exist and contain expected fields:
- `domain-assessment.json` exists and contains `skill_classification.target_skill` and `learner_profile`
- `active-skill.json` exists and contains `active` field

If any required file is missing or its required fields are absent, report the issue to the user rather than proceeding with partial data.

## Process

### NotebookLM RAG / indexed resources

NotebookLM is the required primary path for source-grounded research. The contract is: **links in, compact grounded evidence out; no files in/out**, except the narrow YouTube subtitle/chapter sidecar handled only by `download_yt_subs.sh` through `../scripts/notebooklm/add-youtube-with-subs.mjs`.

1. Before deep research, check whether the phase-scoped NotebookLM endpoint is available through `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_ENDPOINT`. Do not keep NotebookLM enabled outside the research/retrieval phase.
2. Create or locate a convention-compliant notebook through `../scripts/notebooklm/create-notebook.mjs`. Notebook names must follow `LA - <skill-slug> - <skill-id> - <shard>`. New notebooks must be chat-configured immediately to `custom` + `shorter` with concise source-grounded timestamp-aware instructions; creation is incomplete if chat configuration fails.
3. Use `../scripts/notebooklm/research-sources.mjs` for primary source discovery. Run NotebookLM research in `deep` mode for real research (`fast` only for smoke tests), inspect the returned source indices/titles/descriptions, and import only deliberately selected sources. Do not assume low index means high quality. Imported YouTube URLs should be post-processed with `--youtube-subs auto` unless deliberately disabled.
4. Ordinary web search is not a content source. Use it only for URL discovery when NotebookLM source discovery cannot find a required official/creator/resource type, then link/import that URL into NotebookLM before making source-grounded claims.
5. Add sources to NotebookLM by URL/link only: web URLs, YouTube URLs, Drive/doc links, or other approved provider links. Do not upload files, download source files, stage local files, or pass local paths, except subtitle/chapter files produced by `download_yt_subs.sh` for a YouTube URL already being imported.
6. Maintain `learn-anything/<skill-slug>/notebooklm-manifest.json` as a write-through metadata mirror after NotebookLM operations. Use failure-only rollover when a shard refuses new links. For YouTube manifest entries, use `resource_id: yt:<video-id>` and title `<original-title> [<video-id>]`; for sidecars use `yt-sub:<video-id>` / `yt-chapters:<video-id>` and titles ending `.srt.txt` / `.chapters.txt`. Never store raw subtitle or chapter text.
7. For source-grounded deconstruction questions, use RAG-first retrieval across the skill's notebook array. Pass only a compact retrieval pack into the LLM context: short synthesis, selected citations, timestamps/deep links, source IDs, notebook IDs, confidence, and limitations. For video timestamp lookup, use `../scripts/notebooklm/query-video-timestamps.mjs`; timestamps must be backed by NotebookLM subtitle sources, not invented or queried directly from YouTube.
8. Append detailed citations that were actually used to `learn-anything/<skill-slug>/citations.jsonl`. Store normalized citations only; never store raw NotebookLM blobs, raw answers, full dumps, credentials, downloaded files, or private source text.
9. In `skill-dossier.json`, keep `research_sources` lightweight: title/link, format, learning role, audience level, one- or two-line annotation, curation status, resource/source/notebook IDs, selection rationale, and citation refs. Do not store large snippets there.
10. If NotebookLM auth/transport fails, try refresh/reconnect once. If it still fails, ask the user whether to wait/fix NotebookLM, use already saved citations, or stop the source-grounded work. Silent fallback to web-only or uncited knowledge is forbidden.

### Step 1: Landscape Mapping

Use NotebookLM source discovery to survey the territory. Run focused `research-sources.mjs` queries for:
- Existing curricula for this skill (university courses, online courses, textbook table of contents)
- Major "schools of thought" or pedagogical approaches
- Expert discussions about how the skill breaks down
- Controversies or disagreements among practitioners

Spend 3-6 NotebookLM source-discovery queries here. Inspect source titles, URLs, and descriptions before importing. Select sources for coverage, authority, recency, creator/official status, and learning role; record why each selected source was kept. Look for structural information, not just content — how do experts organize this domain?

#### Freshness Assessment

Assess field velocity during landscape mapping:
- Check for: release cadence, recent major version changes, active development blogs/changelogs, version numbers, "what's new" pages
- If the field has had significant changes within the last 6 months, flag as `HIGH_FRESHNESS_RISK` or `VERY_HIGH_FRESHNESS_RISK`
- For HIGH or VERY_HIGH freshness risk: double the NotebookLM source-discovery query budget, prioritize official documentation and creator content (blog posts, tutorials, changelogs, release notes) over general articles
- For technical/product skills: always use NotebookLM discovery to seek official documentation, creator blogs, tutorials from the tool's authors, and recent conference talks — these are higher-signal than third-party articles for rapidly evolving tools

If NotebookLM discovery cannot surface an expected official or creator source, ordinary web search may be used only to discover the URL. Import/link the URL into NotebookLM before using it as evidence.

Record the assessment in the dossier output as `freshness_assessment`.

#### Creator Content Priority

For technical/product skills, prioritize official documentation, creator blogs, tutorials from the tool's authors, and recent conference talks discovered through NotebookLM. These are higher-signal than third-party articles for rapidly evolving tools. Prioritize these over general "how to learn X" articles.

### Step 2: Expert Interview Synthesis (REQUIRED — 6-12 NotebookLM discovery queries)

Read `references/expert-interview-protocol.md` before proceeding. This step is mandatory — execute ALL six Ferriss questions using the query patterns documented there.

For each of the 6 Ferriss questions:
1. Run at least one NotebookLM source-discovery query using the patterns from the protocol
2. Inspect candidate source titles/descriptions before import; keep only sources with clear relevance, authority, and complementary coverage
3. Document findings with source URLs and selection rationale after the sources are imported/indexed
4. Synthesize across perspectives — where experts agree, note consensus; where they disagree, note the controversy

If a question produces zero findings after two NotebookLM source-discovery attempts, note it explicitly with `confidence: LOW` and record what was searched. Ordinary web search may be used only to discover a missing URL, which must then be imported into NotebookLM before being used as evidence.

#### Expert Panel Discovery

During interview synthesis, identify masters of the field — people who have driven the state of the art. For each, note:
- **name**: Full name
- **contribution**: What they're known for in this field
- **teaching_style**: Any known teaching approach or persona (e.g., "Feynman: intuitive, visual, playful explanations", "Knuth: rigorous, methodical, detail-oriented")
- **source_url**: Where this information was found

Store these in the `expert_panel` array in the dossier output. The Curriculum Architect will present these to the learner as potential instructor personas.

Use NotebookLM source-discovery queries such as: "[field] greatest teachers", "[field] best instructors", "[field] pioneers", "[field] thought leaders". If the domain is too niche for recognizable teaching personas, note this — the downstream skill will fall back to asking the learner directly.

### Step 2 Validation Checkpoint

Before proceeding to component identification:
- Verify all 6 Ferriss questions produced at least one finding with a source URL
- Verify `research_sources` will include at least 3 entries with `type: "expert_interview"`
- If fewer than 3 expert_interview sources exist, the research phase is incomplete — conduct additional targeted NotebookLM source-discovery queries

This checkpoint exists because the Ferriss interview protocol is frequently skipped, leading to decompositions that reflect LLM training data rather than real expert perspectives.

### Step 3: Component Identification (Multi-Pass Decomposition)

This is the most critical step. Use a multi-pass approach to avoid blind spots:

**Pass 1 — Top-down:** Start from the skill as a whole. What are the major sub-domains? Break each sub-domain into components. Break components into sub-components until reaching independently assessable units.

**Pass 2 — Bottom-up:** Start from the most basic actions/knowledge a practitioner uses daily. What are the atomic units? Group them upward into logical clusters.

**Pass 3 — Reconcile:** Compare the two decompositions. What did top-down miss that bottom-up caught? What logical groupings from top-down don't appear in bottom-up? Merge into a unified component inventory.

For each component, classify:
- **id**: Generate a stable ID like `vertex-[skill]-[component-name]` (lowercase, hyphenated)
- **label**: `Concept` (abstract knowledge unit) or `Skill` (assessable ability)
- **name**: Short human-readable name
- **description**: What this component covers (2-3 sentences)
- **blooms_level**: What cognitive level is needed to demonstrate competence?
- **component_type**: `recurrent` (needs automation through drill) or `non_recurrent` (needs schema building through varied practice)
- **frequency_score**: 0.0-1.0, how frequently this is used in practice
- **impact_score**: 0.0-1.0, how much mastering this contributes to overall competence
- **confidence**: `high`, `medium`, or `low`
- **verification_needed**: If confidence is `low`, what specifically needs validation?
- **example**: One concrete real-world example demonstrating this component
- **cognitive_load_type**: Classify as `intrinsic` (inherent complexity of the component itself), `extraneous` (complexity from how it's presented — should be minimized), or `germane` (productive complexity that builds schema). Most components are intrinsic. Flag any that are primarily germane (learning-to-learn skills) or that risk extraneous load if poorly taught.
- **assessment_criteria**: Brief description of how mastery of this component can be assessed. Be specific: "Can explain the difference between X and Y" or "Can perform X correctly under Y conditions". This feeds into the Learner Calibrator's question design and Material Forge's assessment instruments.

**Confabulation check:** For EVERY component, provide a specific real-world example. If no example comes to mind, flag the component as potentially confabulated and mark confidence as `low`.

**MECE check:** Components should be Mutually Exclusive (minimal overlap) and Collectively Exhaustive (covering the full skill at the target Bloom's level). Explicitly verify both.

### Step 4: Dependency Graph Construction

Build the prerequisite and relationship structure:

**PREREQUISITE edges** (directed, from prereq to dependent):
- `hard`: Must learn A before B — B is incomprehensible without A
- `soft`: A helps with B but isn't strictly required

**RELATED edges** (undirected, similarity):
- Connect components that share conceptual similarity
- Assign similarity score (0.0-1.0)
- These will be used for embedding-cluster inference during calibration

**REINFORCEMENT edges** (directed, practicing A strengthens B):
- Connect components where practice in one genuinely reinforces another
- Different from prerequisites — A and B may not have a learning dependency, but practicing A improves B

- **cluster_id**: Assign each vertex to a semantic cluster. Group components that naturally belong together (e.g., "foundations", "intermediate-techniques", "advanced-applications"). Use short kebab-case identifiers (e.g., `core-mechanics`, `strategy-layer`, `tooling`). Clusters inform the dashboard visualization and help the Curriculum Architect design task classes.

**Graph quality checks:**
- Every component should have at least one edge (no orphan nodes)
- The prerequisite subgraph should be a DAG (no cycles)
- Gateway nodes (high betweenness centrality) should be intuitively important

Aim for 15-40 components for a typical skill. Fewer than 15 suggests under-decomposition. More than 50 suggests over-decomposition (merge sub-components).

### Step 5: Frequency / Impact Analysis

Estimate the Pareto distribution for this domain:
- What percentage of components account for what percentage of practical competence?
- Is this an 80/20 domain (e.g., language vocabulary)? 90/10? 70/30?
- Identify coverage thresholds: e.g., "the top 8 components (25%) cover ~70% of what is needed for the stated competence level"

Identify **gateway nodes** — components with the highest betweenness centrality in the prerequisite graph. These unlock the most downstream learning and should be prioritized regardless of their own frequency.

### Step 6: Transfer Pathway Identification

Read the learner's related experience from the domain assessment. For each related skill:

1. Identify which components of the TARGET skill are semantically similar to the learner's EXISTING skills
2. Classify the transfer type:
   - **Near (0.90-0.95 similarity)**: Almost the same skill component -> auto-boost mastery estimate
   - **Moderate (0.75-0.90)**: Strong overlap -> suggest accelerated learning path
   - **Far (0.65-0.75)**: Some conceptual overlap -> probe before adjusting
   - **Negative risk (content >0.7 but procedure <0.5)**: Looks similar but works differently -> flag for explicit contrast instruction
3. Describe the transfer pathway in plain language: "Your experience with X means Y is likely partially developed because Z"

### Step 7: Failure Point Catalog

From the expert interviews and landscape mapping, catalog:
- **Beginner mistakes**: Common errors in the first weeks. Include mitigation strategies.
- **Plateaus**: Known sticking points with typical timing. Include what causes them and how to break through.
- **Strategy transitions**: Points where learners need to shift their approach. These look like plateaus but are actually prerequisite to the next leap.
- **Illusion of competence risks**: Where learners commonly overestimate their ability. Specific to this domain.

### Step 8: Produce Output

Write the complete Skill Research Dossier as JSON conforming to `../schemas/skill-dossier.schema.json`. Verify every required field is present. Save to `learn-anything/<skill-slug>/skill-dossier.json`.

### Validate Output

Before writing the output file, verify:
1. The JSON conforms to `../schemas/skill-dossier.schema.json` — all required fields present and correctly typed
2. All UUID fields are valid v4 UUIDs
3. All date-time fields are ISO 8601 format
4. All enum fields use values from the schema's enum lists
5. Array fields that should be non-empty are non-empty

If validation fails, fix the issue before writing. Do not write invalid JSON to the state file.

Present a conversational summary to the learner covering:
1. The major component clusters identified (using plain language, not vertex IDs)
2. The most important components (gateway nodes + high-frequency/high-impact)
3. Transfer pathways — what their existing experience gives them a head start on
4. Key failure points to be aware of
5. Overall confidence level — where the decomposition is solid vs. where it should be validated

## Key Rules

- **Ground everything in NotebookLM-indexed evidence.** The decomposition should reflect how real experts and real curricula structure this skill, not just LLM general knowledge. Every major structural decision should be traceable to at least one imported NotebookLM source and normalized citation; ordinary web search is only a URL-discovery fallback.
- **Flag confidence honestly.** HIGH = supported by multiple expert sources and verified against existing curricula. MEDIUM = supported by general domain knowledge but not specifically validated. LOW = plausible but potentially confabulated — needs verification.
- **Don't over-decompose.** A 25-component graph for "learn basic Python" is better than a 100-component graph. The Curriculum Architect will focus on a subset anyway. Err toward components that are independently assessable and meaningfully distinct.
- **Transfer pathways are a first-class output.** The learner profile exists specifically to identify where existing knowledge accelerates learning. Do not skip this step.
- **The graph structure matters more than individual descriptions.** Getting the prerequisite relationships right is more important than having perfect descriptions. An incorrect prerequisite edge will cause the Curriculum Architect to sequence things wrong.
- **Research sources must be recorded.** Include the URLs and types of sources consulted. This enables future expert validation and shows the learner what the decomposition is based on.

## Update Mode

When invoked for a curriculum update (not initial research), follow a modified process:

1. Read the existing `skill-dossier.json` first
2. Read the update directive (what changed, from the user or the `/update` command)
3. Conduct targeted NotebookLM source discovery and RAG-first retrieval focused on the changes described
4. Compare findings against the existing graph:
   - **New components:** Add as new vertices with appropriate edges. Use new unique IDs — do not reuse existing vertex IDs.
   - **Changed components:** Update existing vertex descriptions, scores, and connections. Preserve the vertex ID.
   - **Deprecated components:** Mark vertices with a note in the description (do not delete — the learner may have progress on them)
5. Update `freshness_assessment` with current date and findings
6. Write the delta summary for the user: what was added, changed, and deprecated

Preserve all existing vertex IDs — changing IDs would break knowledge graph references.

## Handoff

After writing skill-dossier.json, the Learner Calibrator takes over. It reads the dependency graph and transfer pathways to design a diagnostic assessment. Summarize for the learner: the major component clusters found, key transfer pathways from their experience, and that next comes a conversational assessment of what they already know.
